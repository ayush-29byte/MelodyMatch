# MelodyMatch
MelodyMatch is a song recommendation system that uses machine learning to generate music suggestions based on the user's preferences. The system uses a combination of popular libraries such as Streamlit, Mediapipe, and OpenCV to deliver a seamless user experience.

The repository is designed to be easy to use and can be easily integrated into any application or website. The user can access the system via a user-friendly web interface, where they can input their preferred genre of music and the system will generate a list of recommendations based on the input. The recommendations are generated based on machine learning models that have been trained on large datasets of songs and user preferences.

MelodyMatch uses Mediapipe to analyze audio features such as tempo, rhythm, and melody to generate accurate song recommendations. OpenCV is used to extract features from album covers, such as colors and shapes, which are used in combination with audio analysis to generate recommendations. Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface and to deploy the system.

The system is designed to be scalable and can handle large datasets, making it ideal for use in music streaming services or other large-scale applications. The repository includes detailed documentation on how to use the system and how to integrate it into other applications.

Overall, MelodyMatch is a powerful tool for anyone looking to generate personalized song recommendations based on their preferences. It provides an easy-to-use interface and uses advanced machine learning techniques to deliver accurate and relevant recommendations.
